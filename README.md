# sd2psxtd-icondb
A database/repo of custom icons made for SD2PSX

## Info

This repository aims to centralize a collection of icons/splashscreens to be used with [sd2psxtd](https://sd2psxtd.github.io/) and PSXMemCard Gen2 by Bitfunx, allowing people to contribute with their own icon creations + share some of my own.

Included currently are all Dreamcast ports of PS1 and PS2 games (Their icons have been ported from their VMUs) and a few custom made by myself (Wipeout series for the PS1, Serious Sam, TimeSplitters 1 and 2). I'll be adding more and incrementing the repo as time goes.

## Installation

To install the logos to your Memory Card(s), simply copy the PS1 and PS2 folders inside your MemoryCards folder on your SD2PSX SD Card. Once you load a game which has a corresponding icon, it will appear immediately.

## TODO

* Make a proper LIST.TXT document listing all the games currently included on this pack.
* Detail this Read-Me a bit more.
* Add icons from Dreamcast sports games (boooring)
